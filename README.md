# ROTY-game

This is a "little" game I made out of the CS118 coursework

To Play:
Just compile this with the maze-environment like the coursework and then load and run it in the maze-environment. 
Make sure to set the speed to 0, otherwise you'll have a slow sad game.
You can skip the intro with ENTER key, and as a side note for stats - the time taken to complete is from the first move you make.
I have no idea whether reseting it after you finish will correctly reset everything - it's probably best to reload the whole file.

Note: If you look at the code pls don't judge my comments, I made this in like 72 hrs.
